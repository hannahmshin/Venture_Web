Interactive DESIGN

for main page, when the page is first loaded, try to make those blak stipes more engagin



Automate Carousel. Picture will change so does text boxes next to it with different stuff
but there are also arraows so people can manually change it (http://zumtobel.us/). If user hovers 
his/her pointer on the picture, arrow button comes up. If user hovers her mouse over the arrow,
arrows gets longer -> carousel idea http://www.stinkdigital.com/about, http://waaark.com/vision/, http://abritincatering.com/

If user clicks a button, make a surrounding border with yellow color .

Make the purple color something more elemgatn by giving gradient


Search background will be similar to purple... but radial gradient. mix up some colors. 
It will have shorter heights


Search ->  http://www.awwwards.com/sites/tio-luchin-1

Maybe do drop down menu for advanced search!

Before luanching this, do some animation with paragrpsh suchs as ,

Hey there, Ready for a tour? Tell me what you are looking for ! , then show below
I want to explore ----city name---. I --would/would-not-- like to meet other tourist.
I will be in the city on --Month-Day-year--. I will be wearing --types of shoes --.

On the bottom there will be a search button
Mobile version will be all stacked up colums with text field...with appropriate placeholder


FOOTER IDEA!!!
